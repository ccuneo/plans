# Cookbook Plans

As part of Lab 4 and 5 in the Chef Conf 2016 Crafting Reusable Cookbooks, we will be planning cookbook activities.

The plan should include specific information about what will be done and who will be doing it.

The plan could include
 * new or updated tests
 * start of a new cookbook
 * additional functionality
 * new or updated documentation
 * refactored code from attribute driven to resource driven, or removal of repetitious code

Plans should be updated to the COOKBOOK.md within this repo.
